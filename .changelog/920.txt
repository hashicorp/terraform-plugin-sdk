```release-note:enhancement
helper/resource: Added error when errantly checking list, map, or set attributes in `TestCheckNoResourceAttr`, `TestCheckResourceAttr`, and `TestCheckResourceAttrSet`
```

```release-note:note
helper/resource: False positive checks of list, map, and set attributes with `TestCheckNoResourceAttr` and `TestCheckResourceAttrSet` will now return an error to explain how to accurately check those types of attributes. Some previously passing tests will now fail until the check is correctly updated.
```
