```release-note:note
helper/resource: The new terraform-plugin-log `sdk.helper_resource` logger inherits the `TF_LOG`, `TF_LOG_PATH_MASK`, and `TF_ACC_LOG_PATH` environment variable settings, similar to the prior logging. The `TF_LOG_SDK_HELPER_RESOURCE` environment variable can be used to separately control the new logger level.
```
