# Support Policy

Version 2 of the Terraform Plugin SDK is considered **GA (generally
available)** and has the following support policy:

- Critical bug fixes will be accepted and merged. New features and non-critical
bug fixes may be accepted at maintainersâ€™ discretion, but our priority is
maintaining stability.
- We will not break the public interface exposed by the SDK in a minor or patch
release unless a critical security issue or bug demands it, and only then as a
last resort.
- We will continue testing version 2 of the SDK against new releases of Terraform
to ensure compatibility.
- We will not be backporting bug fixes to prior minor releases. Only the latest
minor release receives new patch versions.

# Version 1

Please see the
[v1-maint](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/blob/v1-maint/SUPPORT.md)
branch for the support policy of version 1 of the SDK.
