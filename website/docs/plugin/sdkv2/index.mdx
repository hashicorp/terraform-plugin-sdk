# Terraform Plugin SDKv2

Terraform Plugin SDKv2 is a way to maintain Terraform Plugins on [protocol version 5](/plugin/terraform-plugin-protocol#protocol-version-5).

We recommend using the [framework](/plugin/framework) to develop new provider functionality because it offers significant advantages as compared to the SDKv2. We also recommend migrating existing providers to the framework when possible. Refer to [Plugin Framework Benefits](/plugin/framework-benefits) for higher level details about how the framework makes provider development easier and [Plugin Framework Features](/plugin/framework/migrating/benefits) for a detailed functionality comparison between the SDKv2 and the framework.

## Maintain Existing Providers

- Try the [Call APIs with Custom Providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/providers) tutorials.
- Clone the [terraform-provider-scaffolding](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding) template repository on GitHub.
- Review the SDKv2 documentation for key concepts such as [Schemas](/plugin/sdkv2/schemas) and [Resources](/plugin/sdkv2/resources). 

## Debug and Test

- Learn how to [debug your provider](/plugin/sdkv2/debugging) using either logging calls or a debugging tool.
- Write [acceptance and unit tests](/plugin/sdkv2/testing) for your provider.

## Migrate, Combine, or Translate

- Use the [framework migration guide](/plugin/framework/migrating) to migrate existing providers from SDKv2 to the framework. You can use `terraform-plugin-mux` to migrate individual resources and data sources slowly over time.
- [Combine your provider](/plugin/mux/combining-protocol-version-5-providers) with other [protocol version 5](/plugin/terraform-plugin-protocol#protocol-version-5) providers.
- [Translate your provider](/plugin/mux/translating-protocol-version-5-to-6) into a [protocol version 6](/plugin/terraform-plugin-protocol#protocol-version-6) provider to require Terraform 1.0 and later or to combine with a framework provider and use protocol version 6 exclusive functionality such as nested attributes.
