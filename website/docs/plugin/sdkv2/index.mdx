# Terraform Plugin SDKv2

Terraform Plugin SDKv2 is an established way to develop Terraform Plugins on [protocol version 5](/plugin/how-terraform-works#protocol-version-5).

~> **Important**: [Which SDK Should I Use?](/plugin/which-sdk) explains the differences between Terraform Plugin SDKv2 and [Terraform Plugin Framework](/plugin/framework) to help you decide which option is right for your provider.

## Get Started

- Try the [Call APIs with Custom Providers](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/providers?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorials on HashiCorp Learn.
- Clone the [terraform-provider-scaffolding](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding) template repository on GitHub.

## Key Concepts

- [Schemas](/plugin/sdkv2/schemas) define available fields for provider, resource, or provisioner configuration block, and give Terraform metadata about those fields.
- [Resources](/plugin/sdkv2/resources) are an abstraction that allow Terraform to manage infrastructure objects, such as a compute instance, an access policy, or disk. Providers act as a translation layer between Terraform and an API, offering one or more resources for practitioners to define in a configuration.

## Debug and Test

- Learn how to [debug your provider](/plugin/sdkv2/debugging) using either logging calls or a debugging tool.
- Learn how to [write successful acceptance and unit tests](/plugin/sdkv2/testing) for your provider.

## Combine or Translate

* [Combine your provider](/plugin/mux/combining-protocol-version-5-providers) with other [protocol version 5](/plugin/how-terraform-works#protocol-version-5) providers.
* [Translate your provider](/plugin/mux/translating-protocol-version-5-to-6) into a [protocol version 6](/plugin/how-terraform-works#protocol-version-6) provider to require Terraform 1.0 and later.

## Migrate to Terraform Plugin Framework

The [terraform-plugin-framework](/plugin/framework) is a new way to develop Terraform providers, offering improvements and new features from Terraform Plugin SDKv2. You can refactor individual resources and data sources over time with the following compatibility:

* Terraform 0.12 and later: First, [translate your provider](/plugin/mux/translating-protocol-version-6-to-5) into a protocol version 5 provider. Then [combine your provider](/plugin/mux/combining-protocol-version-5-providers) with the translated provider. You will not be able to use [protocol version 6](/plugin/how-terraform-works#protocol-version-6) features.
* Terraform 1.0 and later: First, [translate your provider](/plugin/mux/translating-protocol-version-5-to-6) into a protocol version 6 provider. Then [combine your provider](/plugin/mux/combining-protocol-version-6-providers) with the translated provider.
