# Logging

Terraform Plugin SDKv2 integrates with a [structured logging framework](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/log): [terraform-plugin-log](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-log). This plays a crucial role in building providers that facilitate timely [debugging](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/debugging) of issues.

## Managing Log Output

Learn how to use [environment variables and other methods](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/log/managing) to enable and filter logs.

## Writing Log Output

Learn how to [implement code in provider logic](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/log/writing) to output logs.

## Filtering Log Output

Learn how to [implement code in provider logic](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/log/filtering) to mask certain log messages and structured log fields or omit logs entirely.

## Log HTTP Transactions

Learn how to [set up the Logging HTTP Transport](./logging/http-transport) to log HTTP Transactions via the [structured logging framework](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/log).
