  Our recommendations for naming resources, data sources, and attributes in
  providers.

## Naming

Most names in a Terraform provider will be drawn from the upstream API/SDK that
the provider is using. The upstream API names will likely need to be
modified for casing or changing between plural and singular to make
the provider more consistent with the common Terraform practices below.

### Resource Names

Resource names are nouns, since resource blocks each represent a single
object Terraform is managing. Resource names must always start with their
containing provider's name followed by an underscore, so a resource from
the provider `postgresql` might be named `postgresql_database`.

It is preferable to use resource names that will be familiar to those with
prior experience using the service in question, e.g. via a web UI it provides.

### Data Source Names

Similar to resource names, data source names should be nouns. The main difference
is that in some cases data sources are used to return a list and can in
those cases be plural. For example the data source
[`aws_availability_zones`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/availability_zones)
in the AWS provider returns a list of availability zones.

### Attribute Names

Below is an example of a resource configuration block which illustrates some
general design patterns that can apply across all plugin object types:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami                    = "ami-408c7f28"
  instance_type          = "t1.micro"
  monitoring             = true
  vpc_security_group_ids = [
      "sg-1436abcf",
  ]
  tags          = {
    Name        = "Application Server"
    Environment = "production"
  }
  root_block_device {
    delete_on_termination = false
  }
}
```

Attribute names within Terraform configuration blocks are conventionally named
as all-lowercase with underscores separating words, as shown above.

Simple single-value attributes, like `ami` and `instance_type` in the above
example, are given names that are singular nouns, to reflect that only one
value is required and allowed.

Boolean attributes like `monitoring` are usually written also as nouns
describing what is being enabled. However, they can sometimes be named as
verbs if the attribute is specifying whether to take some action, as with the
`delete_on_termination` flag within the `root_block_device` block.

Boolean attributes are ideally oriented so that `true` means to do something
and `false` means not to do it; it can be confusing do have "negative" flags
that prevent something from happening, since they require the user to follow
a double-negative in order to reason about what value should be provided.

Some attributes expect list, set or map values. In the above example,
`vpc_security_group_ids` is a set of strings, while `tags` is a map
from strings to strings. Such attributes should be named with _plural_ nouns,
to reflect that multiple values may be provided.

List and set attributes use the same bracket syntax, and differ only in how
they are described to and used by the user. In lists, the ordering is
significant and duplicate values are often accepted. In sets, the ordering is
_not_ significant and duplicated values are usually _not_ accepted, since
presence or absence is what is important.

Map blocks use the same syntax as other configuration blocks, but the keys in
maps are arbitrary and not explicitly named by the plugin, so in some cases
(as in this `tags` example) they will not conform to the usual "lowercase with
underscores" naming convention.

Configuration blocks may contain other sub-blocks, such as `root_block_device`
in the above example. The patterns described above can also apply to such
sub-blocks. Sub-blocks are usually introduced by a singular noun, even if
multiple instances of the same-named block are accepted, since each distinct
instance represents a single object.
