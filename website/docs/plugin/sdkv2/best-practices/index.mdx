# Terraform Plugin Best Practices

A key feature of Terraform is its plugin system, which separates the details of
specific vendor APIs from the shared logic for managing state, managing configuration,
and providing a safe plan and apply lifecycle. Plugins are responsible
for the  implementation of functionality for provisioning resources for a
specific cloud provider, allowing each provider to fully support its unique
resources and lifecycles and not settling for the lowest common denominator
across all provider resources of that type (virtual machines, networks,
configuration management systems, et. al). While each provider is unique, over
the years we’ve accumulated some patterns that should be adhered to, to
ensure a consistent user experience when using Terraform for any given provider.
Listed below are a few best practices we’ve found that generally apply to most
Providers, with a brief description of each, and link to read more. Each
practice is also linked in navigation on the left.

This section is a work in progress, with more sections to come.

## Naming

[Naming][naming] resources, data sources, and attributes in plugins is how plugin authors
expose their functionality to operators and using patterns common to other plugins
lays the foundation for a good user experience.

## Deprecations, Removals, and Renames

Over time, remote services evolve and better workflows are designed.
Terraform's plugin system has functionality to aid in iterative improvements.
In [Deprecations, Removals, and Renames][deprecations], we cover procedures for
backwards compatible code and documentation updates to ensure that operators
are well informed of changes ahead of functionality being removed or renamed.

## Enabling beta features

As a provider, you might want to enable new resources that are still in beta.
Those resources might change later on.
As a general practice, you can enable your provider to support those beta features
by using a environment variable such as `PROVIDERX_ENABLE_BETA`.
Once your resources are out of beta and reach a stable status, you can use those
resources by default without requiring an environment variable.

## Detecting Drift

Terraform is a declarative tool designed to be the source of truth for
infrastructure. In order to safely and predictably change and iterate
infrastructure, Terraform needs to be able to detect changes made outside of
its configuration and provide means of reconciliation. In [Detecting
Drift][drift], we cover some best practices to ensure Terraform's statefile is
an accurate reflection of reality, to provide accurate plan and apply
functionality.

## Testing Patterns

Terraform developers are encouraged to write acceptance tests that create real
resource to verify the behavior of plugins, ensuring a reliable and safe
way to manage infrastructure. In [Testing Patterns][testing-patterns] we cover
some basic acceptance tests that almost all resources should have to validate
not only the functionality of the resource, but that the resource behaves as
Terraform would expect.

## Versioning and Changelog

Terraform development serves two distinct audiences: those writing plugin code
and those implementing them. By clearly and consistently allowing operators to
easily understand changes in plugin implementation via version numbering and
documenting those changes, a trust is formed between the two audiences. In
[Versioning and Changelog][versioning] we cover some guidelines when deciding
release versions and how to relay changes through documentation.
