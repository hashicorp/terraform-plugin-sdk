This best practices section only contains guidance for plugins built with [Terraform Plugin SDK](/terraform/plugin/sdkv2). More generic best practices that apply to both SDK and [Terraform Plugin Framework](/terraform/plugin/framework) can be found in the [Plugin Development Best Practices](/terraform/plugin/best-practices) section.

# Terraform SDKv2 Best Practices

A key feature of Terraform is its plugin system, which separates the details of
specific vendor APIs from the shared logic for managing state, managing configuration,
and providing a safe plan and apply lifecycle. Plugins are responsible
for the  implementation of functionality for provisioning resources for a
specific cloud provider, allowing each provider to fully support its unique
resources and lifecycles and not settling for the lowest common denominator
across all provider resources of that type (virtual machines, networks,
configuration management systems, et. al). While each provider is unique, over
the years, we accumulated recommended patterns that help ensure a consistent user experience when using Terraform for any given provider. This page describes best practices that generally apply to most Providers built with the legacy SDK, with a brief description of each, and link to read more. 

## Deprecations, Removals, and Renames

Over time, remote services evolve and better workflows are designed.
Terraform's plugin system has functionality to aid in iterative improvements.
In [Deprecations, Removals, and Renames][deprecations], we cover procedures for
backwards compatible code and documentation updates to ensure that operators
are well informed of changes ahead of functionality being removed or renamed.

## Enabling beta features

As a provider, you might want to enable new resources that are still in beta.
Those resources might change later on.
As a general practice, you can enable your provider to support those beta features
by using a environment variable such as `PROVIDERX_ENABLE_BETA`.
Once your resources are out of beta and reach a stable status, you can use those
resources by default without requiring an environment variable.

## Detecting Drift

Terraform is a declarative tool designed to be the source of truth for
infrastructure. In order to safely and predictably change and iterate
infrastructure, Terraform needs to be able to detect changes made outside of
its configuration and provide means of reconciliation. In [Detecting
Drift][drift], we cover some best practices to ensure Terraform's statefile is
an accurate reflection of reality, to provide accurate plan and apply
functionality.
