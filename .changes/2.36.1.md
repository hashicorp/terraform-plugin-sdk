## 2.36.1 (February 19, 2025)

NOTES:

* Write-only attribute support is in technical preview and offered without compatibility promises until Terraform 1.11 is generally available. ([#1375](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1375))

BUG FIXES:

* helper/schema: Fixed bug that allowed write-only attributes within set nested blocks. Any attribute within a set nested block with `WriteOnly` set to `true` will now trigger an error message. ([#1427](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1427))
