## 2.29.0 (September 06, 2023)

NOTES:

* all: This Go module has been updated to Go 1.20 per the [Go support policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). It is recommended to review the [Go 1.20 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.20) before upgrading. Any consumers building on earlier Go versions may experience errors. ([#1245](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1245))

FEATURES:

* helper/schema: Upgrade to protocol version 5.4, which can significantly reduce memory usage with Terraform 1.6 and later when a configuration includes multiple instances of the same provider ([#1234](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1234))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* helper/validation: Added `AllDiag` and `AnyDiag`, which are `SchemaValidateDiagFunc` variants of `All` and `Any` ([#1155](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1155))
* helper/validation: Added quoting in `StringInSlice` error diagnostic output to prevent confusion with values that contain spaces ([#464](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/464))
