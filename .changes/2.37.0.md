## 2.37.0 (May 16, 2025)

NOTES:

* all: This Go module has been updated to Go 1.23 per the [Go support policy](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#policy). It is recommended to review the [Go 1.23 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.23) before upgrading. Any consumers building on earlier Go versions may experience errors. ([#1445](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1445))
* all: This release contains new fields and structs for implmenting managed resource identity. Resource identity is data that is defined by a separate schema and is stored alongside resource state. Identity data is used by Terrform to uniquely identify a remote object and is meant to be immutable during the remote object's lifecycle. Resources that support identity can now be imported using the `identity` attribute in Terraform configuration `import` blocks, available in Terraform v1.12+. The `resource.Identity` field on the `schema.Resource` struct can be used to support identity by defining an identity schema. Once the identity schema is defined, you can read and store identity data in the state file with the new `IdentityData` struct that is available via the `Identity()` method on `schema.ResourceData` and `schema.ResourceDiff` structs. ([#1444](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1444))

FEATURES:

* helper/schema: Added new `TestResourceDataWithIdentityRaw` function for creating a `ResourceData` struct with identity data for unit testing. ([#1475](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1475))
* helper/schema: Added new `Identity` field to `Resource` that supports defining an identity schema for managed resources only. ([#1444](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1444))
* Added new `ImportStatePassthroughWithIdentity` helper that can support both identity and ID importing via a single field. ([#1474](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1474))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* helper/schema: Added `RequiredForImport` and `OptionalForImport` fields to the `Schema` struct, which are only valid for identity schemas. ([#1444](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1444))
* helper/schema: Updated `ResourceData` to support passing of identity data in CRUD and import functions for managed resources. ([#1444](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1444))

BUG FIXES:

* helper/schema: Fixed bug that blocked write-only attributes from being used with resources without update functions. ([#1472](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1472))
