kind: NOTES
body: 'all: This release contains new fields and structs for implmenting managed resource identity.
  Resource identity is data that is defined by a separate schema and is stored alongside resource state.
  Identity data is used by Terrform to uniquely identify a remote object and is meant to be immutable during
  the remote object''s lifecycle. Resources that support identity can now be imported using the `identity` attribute
  in Terraform configuration `import` blocks, available in Terraform v1.12+. The `resource.Identity` field on the `schema.Resource`
  struct can be used to support identity by defining an identity schema. Once the identity schema is defined, you can read
  and store identity data in the state file with the new `IdentityData` struct that is available via the `Identity()` method
  on `schema.ResourceData` and `schema.ResourceDiff` structs.'
