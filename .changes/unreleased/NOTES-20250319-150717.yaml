kind: NOTES
body: This alpha pre-release contains an initial implementation for managed resource identity, which can used with Terraform v1.12.0-alpha20250319,
    to store and read identity data during plan and apply workflows. A managed resource identity can be used by defining an identity schema in the
    `resource.Identity` field. Once the identity schema is defined, you can read and store identity data in the new IdentityData struct that is available
    via the new `Identity()` method on ResourceData and ResourceDiff structs.
