body: 'helper/schema: The `Resource` type `EnableApplyLegacyTypeSystemErrors`
  and `EnablePlanLegacyTypeSystemErrors` fields can be enabled to more easily
  discover resource data consistency errors which Terraform would normally
  demote to warning logs. Before enabling the flag in a production release for
  a resource, the resource should be exhaustively acceptance tested as there may
  be unrecoverable error situations for practitioners. It is recommended to
  first enable and test in environments where it is easy to clean up resources,
  potentially outside of Terraform.'
