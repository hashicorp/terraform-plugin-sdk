## 2.26.0 (March 20, 2023)

NOTES:

* This Go module has been updated to Go 1.19 per the [Go support policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy). Any consumers building on earlier Go versions may experience errors. ([#1163](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1163))
* helper/resource: Deprecated `PrefixedUniqueId()` and `UniqueId()`. Use the `helper/id` package instead. These deprecations are to assist in migrating to terraform-plugin-testing ([#1167](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1167))
* helper/resource: Deprecated `RetryContext()`, `StateChangeConf`, and associated `*Error` types. Use the `helper/retry` package instead. These deprecations are to assist in migrating to terraform-plugin-testing ([#1167](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1167))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* helper/id: New `helper/id` package added. `resource.PrefixedUniqueId()` and `resource.UniqueId()` are deprecated, `helper/id` should be used instead. `helper/resource` now contains aliases to the migrated code ([#1167](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1167))
* helper/retry: New `helper/retry` package added. `resource.RetryContext()`, `resource.StateChangeConf`, and associated `*Error` types are deprecated, `helper/retry` should be used instead. `helper/resource now contains aliases to the migrated code ([#1167](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1167))
