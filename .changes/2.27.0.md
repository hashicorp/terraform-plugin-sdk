## 2.27.0 (June 28, 2023)

NOTES:

* helper/schema: Consumers directly referencing the `Resource` type `Schema` field should switch to the `SchemaMap` method to ensure new `SchemaFunc` field data is properly retrieved ([#1217](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1217))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* all: Improved SDK logging performance when messages would be skipped due to configured logging level ([#1202](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1202))
* helper/schema: Added `Resource` type `SchemaFunc` field and `SchemaMap` method, which can reduce resident memory usage with large schemas ([#1217](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1217))
