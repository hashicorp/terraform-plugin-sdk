## 2.37.0-beta.1 (April 18, 2025)

NOTES:

* This beta pre-release continues the implementation of managed resource identity, which should now be used with Terraform v1.12.0-beta2. Managed resources now can support import by identity during plan and apply workflows. Managed resources that already support import via the `schema.Resource.Importer` field still need to set an ID during import when an identity is provided. The `RequiredForImport` and `OptionalForImport` fields on the identity schema can be used to control the validation that Terraform core will apply to the import config block.
