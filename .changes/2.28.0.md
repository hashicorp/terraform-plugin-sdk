## 2.28.0 (August 24, 2023)

NOTES:

* helper/schema: The `Resource` type `EnableApplyLegacyTypeSystemErrors` and `EnablePlanLegacyTypeSystemErrors` fields can be enabled to more easily discover resource data consistency errors which Terraform would normally demote to warning logs. Before enabling the flag in a production release for a resource, the resource should be exhaustively acceptance tested as there may be unrecoverable error situations for practitioners. It is recommended to first enable and test in environments where it is easy to clean up resources, potentially outside of Terraform. ([#1227](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1227))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* helper/schema: Added `Resource` type `EnableLegacyTypeSystemApplyErrors` field, which will prevent Terraform from demoting data consistency errors to warning logs during `ApplyResourceChange` (`Create`, `Update`, and `Delete`) operations with the resource ([#1227](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1227))
* helper/schema: Added `Resource` type `EnableLegacyTypeSystemPlanErrors` field, which can be used to prevent Terraform from demoting data consistency errors to warning logs during `PlanResourceChange` operations with the resource ([#1227](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1227))
