## 2.25.0 (February 15, 2023)

BUG FIXES:

* helper/schema: Allow diagnostic messages with incorrect UTF-8 encoding to pass through with the invalid sequences replaced with the Unicode Replacement Character. This avoids returning the unhelpful message "string field contains invalid UTF-8" in that case. ([#1111](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1111))
* helper/schema: Prevented unexpected difference for timeouts on first plan after import ([#1146](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/issues/1146))
